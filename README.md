### Insertion Sorting
- In insertion sort we start checking from index 1 toward left side, i.e towards 0 index.
- we takes a variable j and make its value to the previous index, i.e int j = i - 1;
- we keep copying value toward right while the previous value is larger than the index i and in the last we simply do j + 1 = key;
